# Contributing to IQBit minigames

Contributions of any kind are welcome! Please follow these steps if you have ideas or found bugs.

1. Check for duplicates. Sometimes there already is a similar issue or pull request, make sure to upvote those instead of creating new ones.
2. If there are no similar issues or pull requests, create an [Issue](https://github.com/iqnite/ronaldo/issues) where you describe your feedback accurately. If you plan to create a pull request to implement it, write that in your issue so developers can discuss it.
3. Once your idea is approved by developers, you can sit back and wait until it gets implemented. Or...
4. Create a [pull request](https://github.com/iqnite/ronaldo/pulls) and implement it yourself!

## Required knowledge base for contributions:
- HTML/CSS/JavaScript
- You can find plenty of tutorials about GitHub pull requests, forks, etc. online

## Contribution guidelines
- Be appropriate. No joke issues, PRs, spam, advertising, etc.
- Test your changes before uploading them. Major changes should be tested on both Firefox and Google Chrome.
- Follow the code format. Put indents etc. where needed. In VSCode, the best way to accomplish this is by simply pressing <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>F</kbd>.
- Don't put pressure. If your pull request is not merged quickly, don't start messaging developers to hurry up. They won't forget it.
